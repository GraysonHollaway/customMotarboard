# Custom Motarboard
Gerber and KiCad files used to make a custom mortarboard decoration for graduation.
This custom PCB sits on top of your gaduation cap and spells out 'ECE OSU' in amber LEDs using a custom designed state machine. 
The clock was implemented with a monostable 555 timer producing an approxamate square wave with tau on the order of 100 milliseconds 
The LEDs are contolled with an NPN BJT such that the digital and analog sections of the circuit are seperated.
